# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
First, when I am interpreting user needs it's important to really listen, I also take detailed notes. Then I can follow up with specific questions that have actionable items related to features that will be implemented. These notes all get put into user stories. The user stories are clear and concise. They are also ranked by priority and size which helps know what is most important and what to start on first. This also helps when estimating the time, it will take to complete the features.


# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I related a lot to the scrum-agile method because it similar to the work I currently do as a production manager. Scrum is organized but also flexible. There is a large emphasis on teamwork, which I believe creates more efficiency. There is a clear process to follow. It also has tools in place to eliminate larger errors in the long run.


# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
There are a lot of important traits to have as a good team member in software development. It is important to be very transparent when it comes to your work. Not only to tell the team when you are thriving but to also let the team know when you need help. Also, it's important to offer help to team members when they need it. Another important trait is to not be concerned about hierarchy and truly focus on being a team. Taking ownership of your work as a team is crucial.
